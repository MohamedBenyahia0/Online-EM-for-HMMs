# Online EM Algorithm for Hidden Markov Models - Reimplementation
This repository reimplements the Online EM Algorithm for HMMs by Olivier Capp√© (2009). The paper presents an online version of the EM algorithm for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), aimed at scalable parameter estimation. This project was completed with my teammate Lilian Say, where we reimplemented the algorithm with Python, tested and evaluated its performance.
